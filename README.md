# NLP Model Analysis Notebook

This notebook provides a comprehensive analysis of Natural Language Processing (NLP) models, focusing on language modeling and regression, as well as classification tasks. It includes data preprocessing, vectorization, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and performance evaluation.

## Data Preprocessing
- **Text Cleaning**: Implements a function to clean and preprocess text data by removing punctuation, numbers, and stopwords.
- **Tokenization**: Utilizes NLTK's word_tokenize to split text into individual words.
- **Lemmatization**: Applies WordNetLemmatizer to reduce words to their base or root form.

## Vectorization
- **Word2Vec**: Encodes text data into numerical vectors using the pre-trained Google News corpus Word2Vec model.
- **Vector Averaging**: Averages word vectors to create a single vector representation for each text sample.

## Model Training
- **Data Preparation**: Prepares the data for training by converting text vectors into a format suitable for machine learning models.
- **Train-Test Split**: Splits the data into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance.

## Hyperparameter Tuning
- **GridSearchCV**: Employs GridSearchCV to find the optimal hyperparameters for various regression and classification models.
- **Models Evaluated**: Includes Support Vector Regression (SVR), Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree Classifier, Logistic Regression, and AdaBoost Classifier.

## Performance Evaluation
- **Regression Metrics**: Evaluates regression models using Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
- **Classification Metrics**: Assesses classification models using precision, recall, f1-score, and support metrics from the classification report[^1^][1].

## Conclusion
Machine learning plays a pivotal role in NLP by enabling the automation of text analysis tasks. It allows for the extraction of meaningful patterns and insights from large volumes of text data, which is essential for applications such as sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and language translation. However sometimes if the data is complicated then classical machine learning algorithms are not suited for classification/regression and Deep learning models are needed to enhance accuracy.
